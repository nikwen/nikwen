## Hey, I'm Niklas ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a founder and software developer based in Berlin.
* I've been coding for 15 years.
* I'm coaching founders and CEOs in learning how to code.

### Terminal Tutor

* I'm building [Terminal Tutor](https://www.terminaltutor.com), an interactive tutorial for learning how to use the command line.
* Within your browser, you get an interactive terminal where you can immediately try what you learn.
* After completing the tutorial, you'll know everything you need to work with the terminal productively.
