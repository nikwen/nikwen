### Hey, I'm Niklas ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a founder and software developer based in Berlin.
* I've been coding for 15 years.
* I'm saving founders 10h/week through [software development coaching](https://www.nikwen.de).

### What I'm working on

* At the moment, I'm developing interactive tech education products.
* I'm starting with [Terminal Tutor](https://www.terminaltutor.com), an interactive tutorial for learning how to use the command line.
* After completing the tutorial, you'll know everything you need to work with the terminal productively.
